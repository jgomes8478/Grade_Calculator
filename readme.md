# Student GPA Calculator

This is a simple command line application for calculating a student's GPA. It asks for the student's name and the number of subjects, and then accepts the grades for each subject. The GPA is calculated by adding the corresponding number of points for each grade and dividing by the total number of subjects.

## Usage

To use the application, run the following command:

```
python calculator.py
```

The application will then prompt you for the student's name and the number of subjects. It will accept the grades for each subject and calculate the GPA. The results will be printed to the console, including the student's name, the number of grades, and the final GPA.

### Example

```
Enter the student's name: Brian Lee
Enter the number of subjects: 5
Enter the grade for subject 1: A
Enter the grade for subject 2: A
Enter the grade for subject 3: B
Enter the grade for subject 4: C
Enter the grade for subject 5: C
Brian Lee received 5 grades with a GPA of 3.00
```
